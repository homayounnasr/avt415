        Ali usually leaves home at 8 oâ€™clock to his workplace, and at best, he has 45 min to drive and 15 min to prepare his breakfast. He usually prefers to take his morning coffee with a donut or a piece of cake, and it makes him to order his breakfast online. 
        Most of the time there is traffic on his path, and he needs to optimize his timing to arrive on time at work. Therefore, he needs to make a drive-thru order before leaving his house. 
        He surfs on the internet to find a local pastry shop to order his coffee and his favorite piece of pastry every morning, and eventually he came across with a local pastry shop application with online ordering system and drive-thru option. </p1>
